            The word kebab has ancient origins. It was popularized in the West by
            Turks to refer to a range of grilled and broiled meat, which may be
            cooked on skewers, including stews, meatballs, and many other forms.
            The word kebab likely came to English in the late 17th century from
            Arabic: كَبَاب kabāb, partly via Urdu, Persian, and kebap Turkish
            according to the Oxford dictionary,[6][2] the Turkish Language
            Association states the same that it is from Arabic: كَبَاب kabāb.[7]
            while according to linguist Sevan Nişanyan, the Turkish word kebap is
            also derived from the Persian word kabāb, meaning roasted meat. It
            appears in Turkish texts as early as the 14th century, in Kyssa-i
            Yusuf (lit. 'the story of Joseph'), though still in the Persian form.
            Nişanyan states that the word has the equivalent meaning of 'frying,
            burning' with kabābu in the old Akkadian language, and kbabā כבבא in
            Aramaic. In contrast, food historian Gil Marks says that the medieval
            Arabic and Turkish terms were adopted from the Persian kabab, which
            probably derived from the Aramaic.

            I love kebab — truly, it’s my constant daydream. I fantasize about
            juicy, spiced meat wrapped in warm bread every single day, imagining
            the tang of sauce, the snap of fresh vegetables and the steam rising
            from a just-made wrap. If I were forced to go more than one day
            without kebab, I’m convinced I would feel empty — even a little lost —
            as if a part of me had gone missing. Kebab is the cornerstone of my
            existence; it comforts me, excites me, and feels almost necessary to
            my happiness. Friends joke that I worship at the altar of the kebab
            shop, but I can’t help it — it’s simply irresistible.
